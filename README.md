Super Smash Bros Project for SI 364

For my project, I originally planned to create a website dedicated to the history behind the fighters in Super Smash Bros Ultimate. For each character, I would include details such as what their original game was (and their original sprite), what franchise the character represented, what year they were created, when they were introduced in the super smash bros series, and any other interesting information such as the number of games they have appeared in outside of Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I planned to use the official super smash bros website to get most of the data about the fighters (https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/fighter/index.html), but I will get include more information about their history from other sites like https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_characters or https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_Super_Smash_Bros._series_characters. I still hope to have a "timeline" feature added so players can see the chronological order of fighters and what ones are more recent than others, but I don't know if I'll be able to figure it out before it is due. I will still have a database on the home page consisting of fighter names and their franchises, sorted by oldest to newest, in case I run out of time. For the user and “login” section of the project, I will either create a comment section or a forum where users can discuss their favorite characters or argue who they think should be added to the Super Smash Bros roster. I think implementing a poll of some type where users can vote on their favorites would be an additional feature that would promote users to engage with the site.
